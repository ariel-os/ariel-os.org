We've completed an important milestone: Ariel OS can now be built using the stable version of the Rust compiler. From the just-released version 0.2 on, you can just use any future RustLang compiler to build your embedded microcontroller project. Check out our [second release](https://github.com/ariel-os/ariel-os/releases/tag/v0.2.0) on GitHub.
